# Step 2 - An Open Source Calculator

In [first step](step-1) we learned a little bit about how a Git code repository operates. For this step, we are going to expand this concept a little and study some crucial definitions to know more about the software world: Open Source/Free Software Licenses.

When choosing how to use code that someone else has written, we face a small barrier to what we are allowed to do with that code. Some modalities, for example, do not allow using a free code without leaving your code free as well.

To do this, we are going to implement a small university average calculator in a repository, with the aim of making it open source.

## Your task

- 1. Create an empty repository on your Github;
- 2. Implement an average calculator according to [this](specification.md) specification;
- 3. Make a pull request with:
  - a) the code you have implemented;
  - b) an open source license or a free source license, justifying why you chose that license.
- 4. Put your name and your repo on the [list of people who completed step 2](completed.md) through a commit in this repository (you need to have forked for this, as in [step 1](../step-1/README.md));
- 5. Make a pull request for us to merge this repository with your forked repository changes.

## What does it exercise?

- Familiarity with Github;
- Familiarity with the notion of `add`, `push`, `commit` and `pull request`;
- Understanding how the open source world works;
- Understanding how the most common software licenses work.
