# Step 1 - Getting to know Git and GitHub

If you've made it this far, you're probably already seeing what GitHub is all about (given that this repository was originally published to GitHub).

GitHub is a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) platform extremely well-known for being the home of [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects and [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) projects.

For a few years now, it has also become a platform for managing enterprise projects, which are kept private on GitHub.

Being the most popular platform for `git` projects, let's learn a little bit about it :)
