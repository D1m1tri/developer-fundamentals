# Fundamentals of Software Development

This repository aims to be a **guide** for new students to learn how to use tools, techniques and programming languages compatible with the Information Systems job market.

Each folder in this repository will represent one tier of this climb, and will contain tips, tutorials, and materials on what needs to be done.

In addition, more senior members of DASI will be on hand should any assistance be needed.

> ‚ùó Attention: this repository is only a guide for your studies and not a programming course. Always try to consult the tutorials and official materials that we recommend, but don't limit yourself to just using them.
